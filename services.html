                                        business can create accurate and reliable financial reports through which you can 
                                    gain insights on which segments or product lines are performing best and how to 
                                        properly allocate resources. Additionally, regular auditing will make your

                                        likely deal with severe fees and legal punishments. Your business will also acquire a 
                                        bad reputation, and you will most likely lose reliability in the eyes of your customers
